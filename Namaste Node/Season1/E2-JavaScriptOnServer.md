# NodeJS - JS on Server

Since, JS is operational on Clients Web Browsers, with the help of `NODE JS`, it is possible to run JS on Servers, thus creating `FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT`.

## Server

Computer which handles the requests from clients.

## V8 Engine

-   V8 Engine is written in C++.
-   V8 Engine can be embedded into any C++ application.
-   V8 Executes JS Codes.
-   V8 Follows ECMA Script Standards.
-   JS --> V8(C++ Program) --> Machine Code.

Node JS is a C++ application with V8 embedded into it and V8 itself can be embedded into any C++ application.

Thus, Node JS can be embedded into any C++ application.

## ECMA Script

-   Standards/Rules.
-   All JS Engines follows these rules.
-   Makes JS Compatible to all the environments.

## JavaScript Runtime (Summarize)

It is a C++ Program, embedded with V8 Engine with some super powers to get more control and functions like API on Server or Modules.

These Powers are written in JS.

## Why V8 is C++ Code ?

All High lvl Code needs to be converted into Binary Code for machines to understand.

FLOW:

```
USER --> JS --> C++(JS Engines) --> Machine Code --> Assembly Code --> Binary Code --> Computer.
```
