# Introduction to Node JS

"An application that can be written in JS will eventually be written in JS."

## NODE JS

-   Run JS Everywhere
-   Cross-Platform
-   JS Runtime Environment
-   Runs on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine
-   Execute JS outside the browser
-   Event Driven Architecture
-   Asynchronous I/O or Non-Blocking I/O

Whenever there is JS there always be a JS Engine and without JS Engine you can't run JS.
